move to Emakefile?


fuse_forward hangs on mount.. in libfuse?

proc_lib, ack...

erl_interface path, current erl version

after open, is read/write serialized per inode?
    read/write returns new state...

fusemount arguments, some kernel mount options.. what others? how to handle?

open from use
    call open in user fs
    send reply
    wait for errno,
        if ENOENT
            call release in user fs
        if ok
            done

fuse device (from userland):

read:
    ENOENT
        just reread
        libfuse: restart
    EINTR
        libfuse: continue..
    EAGAIN
    ENODEV
        libfuse: kern_recv.. just return it
        very bad
    ERESTARTSYS

    EIO

    E2BIG
        setxattr data to large

write:
    ENOENT:
        open
        opendir
        create?
        entry?
            interrupted.. forget node..

    EINVAL:
        invalid fuse message
    EIO:
        ??

dir filler, accumulate in list, build tuple when done?
