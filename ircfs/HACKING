Some notes about the code

FIXME: write more...

String compare via pointers: status = RPL_NOSUCHCHANNEL
Works because of the constants in irc.h etc, but be carefull...
Maybe i will switch to strcmp if this method gets messy.

TALK_PUSH
Sends a message if talk_wait is TRUE (someone is waiting), else skip send
and continue execution

TALK_POP
Wait for a message, will _not_ set talk_wait to TRUE, you have to do it,
most of the times you want to set it before doing something and then wait.
When a message it received, set talk_wait to FALSE and continue execution.

LOCK/UNLOCK
Wrappers for G_LOCK/G_UNLOCK with debug output.

There are most probably some possible deadlocks.


Any questions? feel free to ask, mattias@sudac.org
