Imaginary future frequently asked questions:

Q: Why?
A: Its a fun and stupid idea and you learn much while develop it :)

Q: Why do I kick all users when part a channel?
A: Probably because your file manager recursivly deleted all files and
directories below before deleting the directory itself.
Currently no solution to this, use "rmdir" insted.

Q: How do i join a channel with key protection?
A: It is currently not possible to do via the mkdir syscall, insted try:
echo "JOIN #channel key" > /path/to/mount/quote
